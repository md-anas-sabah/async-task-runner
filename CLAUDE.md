  exponentialBackoff: true,
  maxRetryDelay: 10000,
  timeout: 5000  // 5 second timeout per task
});

const priorityResults = await runPriorityTasks(priorityTasks);

// Event-driven execution
const runner = new AdvancedTaskRunner({
  concurrency: 3,
  eventHandlers: {
    onStart: (taskIndex, metadata) => console.log(`Starting ${metadata?.name}`),
    onComplete: (summary) => console.log(`Completed: ${summary.success} successful`)
