# async-task-runner Development Log

## Current Phase: ⏰ Phase 3 - Timeout Support ✅

### Phase 1 Goals ✅
- ✅ Build a minimal version that accepts a list of async functions
- ✅ Implement concurrency control
- ✅ Return Promise that resolves when all tasks complete
- ✅ Provide the API: `runTasks(tasksArray, { concurrency: 3 })`

### Phase 2 Goals ✅
- ✅ Add retry mechanism for failed tasks
- ✅ Implement configurable retry attempts (`retries`)
- ✅ Add configurable retry delay (`retryDelay`)
- ✅ Implement exponential backoff with max delay limits
- ✅ Add comprehensive logging for retry attempts and failures
- ✅ Maintain detailed retry history in task results

### Phase 3 Goals ✅
- ✅ Abort tasks that exceed specified timeout duration
- ✅ Implement configurable timeout per task (`timeout`)
- ✅ Use AbortController for proper task cancellation
- ✅ Mark tasks as "timed out" with appropriate error handling
- ✅ Track task duration and timeout status in results
- ✅ Integrate timeout with retry mechanism

### Completed Features

#### Phase 1 Features
- ✅ TypeScript setup with production-ready configuration
- ✅ NPM package configuration with proper metadata
- ✅ Core TaskRunner class with concurrency management
- ✅ Type-safe task definitions and results
- ✅ Main `runTasks` function implementation
- ✅ Basic error handling for individual tasks
- ✅ Production-ready package structure

#### Phase 2 Features
- ✅ Intelligent retry mechanism with configurable attempts
- ✅ Exponential backoff algorithm with customizable parameters
- ✅ Maximum retry delay caps to prevent excessive waits
- ✅ Comprehensive logging system (silent by default, optional verbose)
- ✅ Detailed retry history tracking in results
- ✅ Dual API: `runTasks()` (silent) and `runTasksWithLogging()` (verbose)
- ✅ Production-ready retry logic tested across multiple scenarios

#### Phase 3 Features
- ✅ Intelligent timeout mechanism with AbortController support
- ✅ Configurable timeout duration per task execution
- ✅ Precise timeout detection and error classification
- ✅ Duration tracking for all task executions (success and failure)
- ✅ Timeout integration with retry system (retries respect timeouts)
- ✅ Timeout history tracking in retry attempts
- ✅ Custom TimeoutError class for proper error identification
- ✅ Performance-optimized timeout wrapper with cleanup

### Technical Implementation

#### Core Architecture
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- **Module System**: ES Modules
- **Concurrency Strategy**: Promise.race() based queue management
- **Error Handling**: Individual task failures don't stop the entire queue
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript definitions for all interfaces

#### Retry System
- **Retry Strategy**: Configurable attempts with intelligent backoff
- **Exponential Backoff**: Base delay × 2^(attempt-1) with max cap
- **Logging**: Structured logging with different verbosity levels
- **History Tracking**: Complete retry attempt history with timestamps and delays

#### Timeout System
- **Timeout Strategy**: AbortController-based task cancellation
- **Precision**: High-resolution timing with performance.now()
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with retry mechanism
- **Error Handling**: Custom TimeoutError with duration information
- **Cleanup**: Automatic timeout cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### API Usage Examples

#### Basic Usage with Retries and Timeout
```typescript
import { runTasks } from 'async-task-runner';

const results = await runTasks(tasks, { 
  concurrency: 3,
  retries: 3,
  retryDelay: 1000,
  exponentialBackoff: true,
  maxRetryDelay: 10000,
  timeout: 5000  // 5 second timeout per task
});
```

#### With Logging and Timeout
```typescript
import { runTasksWithLogging } from 'async-task-runner';

const results = await runTasksWithLogging(tasks, {
  concurrency: 3,
  retries: 3,
  retryDelay: 1000,
  exponentialBackoff: true,
  timeout: 3000  // 3 second timeout
});
```

#### Custom Logger with Full Config
```typescript
import { TaskRunner, DefaultLogger } from 'async-task-runner';

const logger = new DefaultLogger(true);
const runner = new TaskRunner({ 
  concurrency: 3, 
  retries: 3,
  timeout: 2000
}, logger);

const results = await runner.run(tasks);
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `concurrency` | number | 3 | Maximum concurrent tasks |
| `retries` | number | 0 | Number of retry attempts |
| `retryDelay` | number | 1000 | Base delay between retries (ms) |
| `exponentialBackoff` | boolean | false | Enable exponential backoff |
| `maxRetryDelay` | number | 30000 | Maximum retry delay (ms) |
| `timeout` | number | undefined | Maximum task duration (ms) |

### Test Results

#### Phase 2 - Retry Logic
- ✅ Basic retry functionality: Tasks succeed after configured attempts
- ✅ Exponential backoff: Delays increase exponentially (500ms → 1000ms → 2000ms)
- ✅ Max delay caps: Exponential delays respect maximum limits
- ✅ Mixed scenarios: Success/failure combinations with detailed tracking
- ✅ Concurrency + retries: Proper queue management during retry operations

#### Phase 3 - Timeout Support
- ✅ Basic timeout: Tasks abort after specified duration (1000ms timeout working)
- ✅ Timeout + retries: Failed timeouts trigger retry attempts with new timeouts
- ✅ Duration tracking: Precise timing for all task executions
- ✅ Timeout detection: Proper TimeoutError classification vs regular errors
- ✅ Concurrent timeouts: Multiple tasks timing out simultaneously handled gracefully
- ✅ Integration: Timeout system works seamlessly with retry and concurrency

### Next Phases (Planned)
- **Phase 4**: Progress tracking and events
- **Phase 5**: Advanced queue management (priority, dependencies)
- **Phase 6**: Task dependencies and conditional execution
