## üîß Customization

Each example includes:
- **Configurable parameters** - Adjust concurrency, timeouts, and retry settings
- **Realistic failure simulation** - See how the system handles various error conditions
- **Performance metrics** - Monitor execution time, success rates, and throughput
- **Extensible patterns** - Easy to adapt for your specific use cases

## üìà Performance Tips

Based on the examples, here are key performance optimization strategies:

1. **Concurrency Tuning**
   - Start with moderate concurrency (2-5)
   - Monitor resource usage and adjust accordingly
   - Consider target system limitations (API rate limits, server capacity)

2. **Retry Strategy**
   - Use exponential backoff for rate-limited APIs
   - Set reasonable maximum retry delays
   - Implement different retry counts for different operation criticality

3. **Timeout Configuration**
   - Set timeouts based on expected operation duration
   - Use shorter timeouts for user-facing operations
   - Allow longer timeouts for complex batch operations

4. **Error Handling**
   - Categorize errors to apply appropriate retry strategies
   - Log detailed error information for debugging
   - Implement circuit breaker patterns for cascading failures
