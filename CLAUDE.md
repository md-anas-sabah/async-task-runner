### Technical Implementation

#### Core Architecture
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- **Module System**: ES Modules
- **Concurrency Strategy**: Promise.race() based queue management
- **Error Handling**: Individual task failures don't stop the entire queue
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript definitions for all interfaces

#### Retry System
- **Retry Strategy**: Configurable attempts with intelligent backoff
- **Exponential Backoff**: Base delay × 2^(attempt-1) with max cap
- **Logging**: Structured logging with different verbosity levels
- **History Tracking**: Complete retry attempt history with timestamps and delays

#### Timeout System
- **Timeout Strategy**: AbortController-based task cancellation
- **Precision**: High-resolution timing with performance.now()
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with retry mechanism
- **Error Handling**: Custom TimeoutError with duration information
- **Cleanup**: Automatic timeout cleanup to prevent memory leaks

#### Summary & Reporting System
- **Execution Analytics**: Comprehensive metrics collection and analysis
- **Error Intelligence**: Automatic error categorization and frequency analysis
- **Performance Tracking**: Detailed timing and throughput measurements
- **Report Generation**: Human-readable formatted summary reports
- **Statistical Analysis**: Success rates, retry patterns, and failure insights

### API Usage Examples

#### Basic Usage with Retries and Timeout
```typescript
import { runTasks } from 'async-task-runner';

const results = await runTasks(tasks, { 
  concurrency: 3,
  retries: 3,
  retryDelay: 1000,
  exponentialBackoff: true,
  maxRetryDelay: 10000,
  timeout: 5000  // 5 second timeout per task
});
```

#### With Logging and Timeout
```typescript
import { runTasksWithLogging } from 'async-task-runner';

const results = await runTasksWithLogging(tasks, {
  concurrency: 3,
  retries: 3,
  retryDelay: 1000,
  exponentialBackoff: true,
  timeout: 3000  // 3 second timeout
});
```

#### Custom Logger with Full Config
```typescript
import { TaskRunner, DefaultLogger } from 'async-task-runner';

const logger = new DefaultLogger(true);
const runner = new TaskRunner({ 
  concurrency: 3, 
  retries: 3,
  timeout: 2000
}, logger);

const results = await runner.run(tasks);
```

#### Summary Reports
```typescript
import { runTasksWithSummary, formatSummary } from 'async-task-runner';

const summary = await runTasksWithSummary(tasks, {
  concurrency: 3,
  retries: 2,
  timeout: 5000
});

console.log(formatSummary(summary));
// Output:
// 📊 Task Execution Summary
// ✅ Successful: 8
// ❌ Failed: 2
// ⏰ Timed out: 1
// 🔄 Total retries: 4
// ...
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `concurrency` | number | 3 | Maximum concurrent tasks |
| `retries` | number | 0 | Number of retry attempts |
| `retryDelay` | number | 1000 | Base delay between retries (ms) |
| `exponentialBackoff` | boolean | false | Enable exponential backoff |
| `maxRetryDelay` | number | 30000 | Maximum retry delay (ms) |
| `timeout` | number | undefined | Maximum task duration (ms) |

### Test Results

#### Phase 2 - Retry Logic
- ✅ Basic retry functionality: Tasks succeed after configured attempts
- ✅ Exponential backoff: Delays increase exponentially (500ms → 1000ms → 2000ms)
- ✅ Max delay caps: Exponential delays respect maximum limits
- ✅ Mixed scenarios: Success/failure combinations with detailed tracking
- ✅ Concurrency + retries: Proper queue management during retry operations

#### Phase 3 - Timeout Support
- ✅ Basic timeout: Tasks abort after specified duration (1000ms timeout working)
- ✅ Timeout + retries: Failed timeouts trigger retry attempts with new timeouts
- ✅ Duration tracking: Precise timing for all task executions
- ✅ Timeout detection: Proper TimeoutError classification vs regular errors
- ✅ Concurrent timeouts: Multiple tasks timing out simultaneously handled gracefully
- ✅ Integration: Timeout system works seamlessly with retry and concurrency

#### Phase 4 - Task Result Reporting
- ✅ Structured summaries: Complete execution analytics with success/failure breakdown
- ✅ Error aggregation: Intelligent categorization by type with frequency analysis
- ✅ Performance metrics: Total duration, averages, execution time, and throughput
- ✅ Retry analysis: Comprehensive retry statistics and failure pattern detection
- ✅ Formatted reports: Human-readable summary output with detailed breakdowns
- ✅ Timeline tracking: Start/end timestamps with precise execution timing

### Next Phases (Planned)
- **Phase 5**: Progress tracking and events
- **Phase 6**: Advanced queue management (priority, dependencies)
- **Phase 7**: Task dependencies and conditional execution
